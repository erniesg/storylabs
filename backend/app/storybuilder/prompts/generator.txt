<Story Structure Rules>
1. Each scene must start with a narration event setting the scene
2. Character dialogue must be preceded by relevant narration
3. Sound effects should be incorporated into narration, not dialogue
4. Scene transitions must be handled by narrator
5. Character emotions should be shown through dialogue and narrated actions, not mixed together
