      "Once there was a man and a woman who wanted a baby. They wished for a long time. One day, the woman saw a garden from her window. It was full of beautiful flowers and herbs, but it had a high wall. The garden belonged to a powerful enchantress, and no one dared to go in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman saw a plant called rampion in the garden. It looked so fresh and green that she really wanted to eat it. She felt so sick without it. Her husband noticed and asked, \"What is wrong, dear wife?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want some rampion from the garden,\" she replied. \"If I can't eat it, I will feel very sad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband cared for her and thought, \"I will bring her some rampion.\" That night, he climbed over the wall and picked some. He gave it to his wife, and she made a salad. It tasted so good that she wanted more the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband went back to the garden to get more rampion, but this time he saw the enchantress. She was angry. \"How dare you steal my rampion?\" she yelled. The husband was scared but explained, \"My wife wanted it so much. If she doesn’t eat it, she will be very sad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The enchantress felt sorry for him and said, \"You may take as much rampion as you want, but you must give me the child your wife has when it is born. I will take care of the baby.\" The husband was so scared that he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman had a baby girl, the enchantress took her and named her Rapunzel. Rapunzel grew up to be very beautiful. When she was twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tall tower. There was no door, only a small window.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the enchantress came to visit, she called out, \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!\" Rapunzel had long, golden hair. She let her hair down, and the enchantress climbed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a prince rode through the forest. He heard Rapunzel singing and stopped to listen. He wanted to see her but couldn’t find the door. Every day, he came back to hear her lovely voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, he saw the enchantress come and heard her call for Rapunzel. He thought, \"I will try this too!\" The next day, he called, \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!\" Her hair fell down, and he climbed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapunzel was scared when she saw the prince, but he spoke kindly. He told her that he had to see her because her song was beautiful. Soon, Rapunzel was not afraid anymore. When he asked her to marry him, she said yes! \n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to escape, but she didn’t know how. \"Bring me silk every time you come,\" she said. \"I will make a ladder, and we can leave together.\" They agreed to meet every evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enchantress didn't notice at first, but one day, Rapunzel said, \"You are so heavy to pull up!\" The enchantress grew angry and cut off Rapunzel's hair. She sent Rapunzel away to live alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince came and called, \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!\" the enchantress let down the cut hair instead. The prince climbed up, but there was no Rapunzel. The enchantress laughed, \"She is gone! You will never see her again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was heartbroken. He jumped from the tower and landed in a thorny bush. He hurt his eyes and could not see! He wandered through the forest for many years, feeling sad.\n",
      "\n",
